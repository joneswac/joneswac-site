# Wes Jones as a tech

If it weren't for some lucky accidents in college, I would be teaching high school students right now. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just much happier right now. Can you imagine how much more cynical I would be if I was a historian?

I started as a student tech for the Department of Residence at University of Northern Iowa. It was a good fit, I had a great manager and I learned new things constantly. It took me a while, but eventually I dropped my teaching degree and finished college a semester sooner (turns out social science teachers need more than four years to complete their schooling) with a history degree. I loved being a history student, but I didn't want to be a historian. It was awkward in my senior seminar when the rest of the class went around the room and discussed places they were applying to work or the masters programs they were interested in. My turn arrived and I explained that I had already interviewd for a couple jobs in technology. Some people looked at me like "Why are you here?" I get those looks a lot.

I worked for a MSP for a year and a half, but I missed UNI. I liked the organization and I knew what was right for me. When I was a student tech, I did meaningful work. The tasks I took on were professional, in some cases they are still active today. I found that coming back to UNI was like coming back to a new part of the town you were born in. When I was a student I did desktop support, but now I am a sysadmin. I got the best of both worlds, but IMHO the grass is greener in sysadminland.
